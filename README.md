# RegistrationRevisited
This project aims to rebuild the UTD registration system by using our algorithms to evaluate potential courses the user will have available to them alongside revealing a lot of hidden data.

# Input
The input for this project is a text file which should be formatted as the "oaa200003.txt" text file. Since we do not have access to UTD servers, we cannot scrape the website for your information unless this was incorporated by a galaxy developer. For now, the input must be like this, however in the future galaxy could automatically get this info.
